# Psychic-Game

This is an example of a game where the computer chooses a random letter and the user has 9 chances to guess the letter the computer chose.

Each guess the user inputs will be displayed in "Your Guesses so far" so they can keep track of all previous guesses.

If the user guesses the correct letter, their score under "Wins" will increase by 1, "Guesses Left" will reset to 9, and "Your Guesses so far" will be cleared and the computer will choose a new random letter so the game can be played again.

If the user runs out of guesses without getting the correct letter their score under "Losses" will increase by 1, "Guesses Left" will reset to 9, "Your Guesses so far" will be cleared, and the computer will choose a new random letter so the game can be played again.
